# ✅ Manufacturer Portal - Upload Fix

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Single entry upload and bulk upload were not working in the manufacturer portal.

**Root Cause**: The `uploadedData` was defined as a constant array, making it immutable. Direct mutations like `uploadedData.unshift()` and `uploadedData.splice()` were not working.

---

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### **1. Converted to State**
Changed `uploadedData` from a constant to a React state variable:

```javascript
// Before (Not working)
const uploadedData = [/* data */];

// After (Working!)
const [uploadedData, setUploadedData] = useState([/* data */]);
```

### **2. Fixed handleSubmitICData**
Updated to use state setter for adding/updating entries:

```javascript
// Add new entry
setUploadedData(prevData => [newEntry, ...prevData]);

// Update existing entry
setUploadedData(prevData => 
  prevData.map(item => 
    item.id === editingEntry.id ? { ...newEntry, id: editingEntry.id } : item
  )
);
```

### **3. Fixed handleDelete**
Updated to use state setter for deleting entries:

```javascript
// Before (Not working)
uploadedData.splice(index, 1);

// After (Working!)
setUploadedData(prevData => prevData.filter(item => item.id !== id));
```

### **4. Fixed handleBulkSubmit**
Updated to use state setter for bulk uploads:

```javascript
// Before (Not working)
bulkPreview.forEach(entry => {
  uploadedData.unshift({ ...entry, status: 'Verified' });
});

// After (Working!)
const verifiedEntries = bulkPreview.map(entry => ({ ...entry, status: 'Verified' }));
setUploadedData(prevData => [...verifiedEntries, ...prevData]);
```
